# Unsupported markdown features

## Non exhaustive list

This project uses the MyST variant of markdown, which is a superset of the CommonMark specification. As a result, we do not support all of markdown features that are usually commonly in use. Here is a non-exhaustive list of unsupported markdown features.

### Strikethrough

```
Strikethrough with ~~two tildes~~.
```

Strikethrough with ~~two tildes~~.

### Unsupported image formats

Please consult the [latest MyST documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/figures#supported-image-formats) on which image formats are not supported. **Using an unsupported format can result in invalid rendering of an image.
