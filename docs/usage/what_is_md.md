# Introduction to Markdown

## What is Markdown

> Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents [...] The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

## Markdown's variant

The project supports MyST markdown, which is a superset of the CommonMark, a variant of the Markdown markup language.
